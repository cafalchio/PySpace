# PySpace - A Python Space Shooter

## Introduction

The game was created as a project for the course "Diploma in Software Development at Code Institute" in 2022. The requirement was to create an iteractive pure Terminal Python app deployed on a front end website. The game is a space shooter with a simple storyline. A space pilot who has to defend Earth from enemy ships. He can move his ship in all directions and shoot at the enemy ships. The game ends when the player loses all his lives. The best score is saved in a database and displayed on the website.

## Features

### Main Page

The main page is the first page that the user sees when they visit the site. It has four buttons, one to start the game, one to see the rules, one to see the options and one to see the results.

Once the player has started the game, the the Start Game button will be replaced by a button to restart the game.
All menus pages have a button to return to the main page and a button to close the menu.

### Options Menu

The options menu allows the user to change the game settings. The user can change the sound On/Off and the higlight On/Off. The highlight is the highlight of the possible moves of the selected piece. The sound is the sound of the pieces moving and the sound of the pieces being captured.

### Game

The game page is where the game will be played, it has a board with 64 squares, 32 of which are occupied by 16 black and 16 white pieces. The pieces are placed in the 12 squares closest to each player. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces or to block them so that they cannot move.
Once in the Game, the user can go back to the menu using the small cog icon in the top right corner of the screen.

## Testing

The website was tested on a desktop computer and a mobile phone.
Also, W3C and Jigsaw validation was used to validate the website HTML and CSS.

One warning here but was part of the implementation of the game.
Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics.

## Unfixed Bugs

- Based on the checkers rules, the player needs to capture as many pieces as possible. The game is not programmed to do that neither to check if the player is taking the best possible move. The game is programmed to force a take.

- The computer is not programmed to take the best possible move. The computer is programmed to take a random piece.

- It was reported to crash in Android, but I was not able to reproduce the error.

## Features Left to Implement

- Implement a better AI for the computer.
- A timer to limit the time of each player.
- A smoother animation for the pieces moving.
- In the future, a multiplayer mode.

## Deployment

- The game was deployed on GitHub pages.
